AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

# Acceptance Criteria
I used the other lessons learned during the JavaScripts lessons to develop some of the code in order to develop this generator. In addition a web developer on github had code which helped clarify the project a bit more.
